[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Productivity/Entertainment

- **Story:** This app allows for a portable database of information on the user's characters. This allows the user to reference that information from any location with ease.
- **Market:** This app can be useful for authors, artists, game developers, and other people that create characters.
- **Habit:** Users will use this alongside whatever creative media they are making (novel, game, etc), so they will frequently come back to the app.
- **Scope:** The scope of this app is adjustable depending on what features we would decide to do. The scope could be more complex when thinking about the organization of characters (ie. including a family tree option).
